# Control Flow and Conditional Statements in JavaScript

This folder explores how JavaScript controls the flow of program execution and makes decisions using conditional statements. It includes examples and explanations of various control flow structures.

## Contents

- `01_if_statement.js` — Basic usage of the `if` statement
- `02_else_if_statement.js` — How to use `else if` for multiple conditions
- `02_else_if-statement.html` — HTML example demonstrating conditional logic
- `03_nested_if_else_statement.js` — Nested `if-else` statements for complex decision making
- `04_switch_statment.js` — Using the `switch` statement for multiple cases
- `05_ternay_operator.js` — The ternary operator for concise conditional expressions
- `NOTES.md` — Additional notes and explanations
- `README.md` — This documentation file

## Key Concepts

1. **If Statement:** Execute code blocks based on conditions
2. **Else If & Else:** Handle multiple and fallback conditions
3. **Nested Conditionals:** Structure complex decision logic
4. **Switch Statement:** Simplify multi-case selection
5. **Ternary Operator:** Write short conditional expressions

## How to Use

1. Review each `.js` file for code examples and explanations
2. Refer to `NOTES.md` for summary points and extra details
3. Experiment by running the scripts in your browser or Node.js environment
4. Use the HTML file for interactive demonstration
