# Looping and Iteration in JavaScript

This folder covers the essential looping constructs in JavaScript, which allow you to repeat actions and iterate over data structures. It includes examples and explanations for each type of loop.

## Contents

- `01_for_loop.js` — Demonstrates the classic `for` loop
- `02_while_loop.js` — Shows how to use the `while` loop
- `03_do_while_loop.js` — Explains the `do...while` loop
- `04_for_of_loop.js` — Iterates over iterable objects using `for...of`
- `05_for_in_loop.js` — Iterates over object properties using `for...in`
- `NOTES.md` — Additional notes and explanations
- `README.md` — This documentation file

## Key Concepts

1. **For Loop:** Repeat actions a specific number of times
2. **While Loop:** Repeat actions while a condition is true
3. **Do...While Loop:** Execute actions at least once, then repeat while a condition is true
4. **For...Of Loop:** Iterate over arrays, strings, and other iterable objects
5. **For...In Loop:** Iterate over the properties of an object

## How to Use

1. Review each `.js` file for code examples and explanations
2. Refer to `NOTES.md` for summary points and extra details
3. Experiment by running the scripts in your browser or Node.js environment
