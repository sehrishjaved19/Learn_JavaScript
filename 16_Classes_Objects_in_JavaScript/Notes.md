# Classes and Objects in JavaScript

## Class
_**A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in JavaScript. It defines the structure and behavior by encapsulating data, or properties, and methods, or functions that are common to a group of objects.**_

* Classes provide a way to model real-world entities, bringing a level of abstraction to your code. 

---

## Object
_**Objects are specific instances of a class created based on the class blueprint. They represent specific entities on unique values for the properties defined in the class.**_

* Objects encapsulate state or property values and behavior or methods in a single unit.

---

## Object Literals
_**Object literals are a way to create ad hoc objects without defining a class.**_

* Ad hoc objects are objects created for a specific, temporary purpose — usually to hold or manipulate data on the fly — rather than being part of a predefined class or structure.

## Function Constuctors
_**Function constructors are regular JavaScript functions used to create and initialize objects. It's a convention to name functional constructors with an initial capital letter.**_

## Object Literals versus Function Constructors
| **Aspect** | **Object Literals** | **Function Constructors** |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Suitable for ad hoc objects | Ideal for creating multiple instances with shared properties and methods |
| **Use Case** | Storing individual customer orders | Creating instances of objects like "Car" |
| **Scenario** | Unique details for specific instances | Managing and modeling multiple similar objects (users, products, vehicles) |
| **Advantages** | Quick creation of one-off objects | Provides a structured and organized approach |
| **Applicability** | Adaptable for various scnerious | Especially useful for object-oriented programming in JavaScript |

## Accessing Object Properties
* In JavaScript, you can access objects and their properties using dot or bracket notations.

### Dot Notation
**Dot notation is the most common way to access object properties. You use a dot followed by the property name.**

### Bracket Notation
**Bracket notation is also handy when you need to access properties dynamically, such as with variables.**

#### Note:
* Both dot and bracket notation serve the same purpose, accessing object properties. You can choose the one that best suits your needs and coding style.

## Array of Object
**An array of objects is a common and powerful way to store and manage structured data in JavaScript. They allow you to organize and manipulate data in a structured manner by combining the features of both arrays and objects.**
