# 🧠 Learn JavaScript

A structured collection of JavaScript learning exercises, notes, and mini-projects that document my journey from fundamentals to advanced concepts.  
This repository showcases my continuous progress as I master front-end and full-stack web development.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository is divided into topic-based folders that cover the **core foundations of JavaScript**, including syntax, DOM manipulation, events, functions, APIs, and asynchronous programming.  
Each folder contains short practice examples, mini-labs, or small demo projects that apply key concepts.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

| Folder | Topic / Description |
|:-------|:--------------------|
| `00_cheatsheet_javascript` | Quick reference notes for syntax and concepts |
| `01_variables_and_datatypes` | Working with variables, constants, and data types |
| `03_conditionals` | If-else, switch, ternary operators |
| `04_looping_and_iteration` | For, while, do-while, forEach loops |
| `06_functions_and_scope` | Function declarations, expressions, and scope |
| `10_arrays_and_objects` | Array methods, object manipulation |
| `15_dom_manipulation` | Accessing and updating the Document Object Model |
| `20_lab_random_quote_generator` | Mini-project: generate random quotes dynamically |
| `25_events_in_javascript` | Event listeners and event handling |
| `31_lab_form_validation` | Mini-project: form validation example |
| `37_javascript_api` | Working with APIs and asynchronous requests |

*(Each folder is self-contained, with code and HTML examples where relevant.)*

## 🚀 Featured Mini-Projects

| Project | Description | Demo |
|:---------|:-------------|:-----|
| **Random Quote Generator** | Displays random motivational quotes using JS arrays and DOM manipulation | *(coming soon)* |
| **Form Validation Lab** | Demonstrates input validation and dynamic error messages | *(coming soon)* |
| **Weather API Example** | Fetches and displays weather data using Fetch API | *(coming soon)* |

> 💡 *Each project folder contains its own `index.html` and `.js` files — just open the HTML file in a browser to test.*

## 📖 What I Learned

* Building interactive web pages using vanilla JavaScript.
* Understanding the connection between HTML structure and JS logic.
* Practicing clean, commented, and readable code.
* Applying theory through small, practical examples and labs.

---

## 🧱 Future Improvements

* Add screenshots and live demos for all major labs.
* Deploy selected projects using GitHub Pages or Vercel.
* Include more advanced topics: modules, local storage, and error handling.
