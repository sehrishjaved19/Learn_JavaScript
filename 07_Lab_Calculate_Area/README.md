# Lab: Calculate Area in JavaScript

This folder contains a lab exercise for calculating the area of different geometric shapes using JavaScript. The included files provide an interactive web page, supporting styles, and JavaScript logic for area calculations.

## Contents

- `calculate_area.html` — Interactive web page for area calculation
- `calculate_area.css` — Stylesheet for the lab interface
- `calculate_Area.js` — JavaScript code for calculating areas
- `README.md` — This documentation file

## Lab Objectives

1. Practice using JavaScript to perform mathematical calculations
2. Implement functions to calculate the area of various shapes (e.g., rectangle, circle, triangle)
3. Create an interactive user interface for input and output
4. Apply DOM manipulation and event handling

## How to Use

1. Open `calculate_area.html` in your browser to use the area calculator
2. Enter the required dimensions for the shape you want to calculate
3. View the calculated area displayed on the page
4. Review and modify `calculate_Area.js` to experiment with different logic or add new shapes
