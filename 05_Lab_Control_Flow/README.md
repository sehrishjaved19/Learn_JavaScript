# Lab: Control Flow in JavaScript

This folder contains a practical lab for learning and practicing control flow concepts in JavaScript. The included files demonstrate how to use decision-making structures to guide program execution.

## Contents

- `control_flow.html` — Interactive web page for control flow exercises
- `control_flow.js` — JavaScript code implementing control flow logic
- `README.md` — This documentation file

## Lab Objectives

1. Practice using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements
2. Implement switch statements for multi-way branching
3. Use ternary operators for concise conditional logic
4. Explore nested conditionals and complex decision structures

## How to Use

1. Open `control_flow.html` in your browser to view and interact with the lab
2. Study and modify `control_flow.js` to experiment with different control flow scenarios
3. Use the examples to reinforce your understanding of JavaScript decision-making
