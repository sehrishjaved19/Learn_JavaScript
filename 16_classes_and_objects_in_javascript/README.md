# Classes and Objects in JavaScript

This module explores the concepts of classes and objects in JavaScript, covering different ways to create and manipulate objects, as well as working with arrays of objects and nested structures.

## Topics Covered
- Creating classes and objects
- Object literals
- Function constructors
- Accessing object properties (dot and bracket notation)
- Arrays of objects
- Methods to modify arrays of objects
- Nested arrays of objects

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the difference between classes, objects, and constructors in JavaScript
- Learn various ways to create and manipulate objects
- Practice accessing and updating object properties
- Work with arrays of objects and nested data structures
- Apply methods to modify and traverse complex object arrays

## Usage
1. Open each `.js` file in your code editor or run them in the browser/Node.js to see examples and outputs.
2. Review `NOTES.md` for further explanations and tips.
