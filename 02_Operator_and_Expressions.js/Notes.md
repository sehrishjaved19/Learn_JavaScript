# Operators and Expressions in JavaScript

# Operator
**Operators in JavaScript are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values.

## Variety of Operators:

* Arithmetic Operators
* Comparison Operators
* Logical Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Unary Operators
* Type of Operator

---
## Arithmetic Operator
**Arithmetic Operators are used for basic mathematical calculations.**

### Common arithmetic operators include:
* addition +
* subtraction -
* multiplication *
* division /
* modulus % (remainder)
---
## Comparison Operator
**Comparison operators are used to compare two values or variables and return a Boolean true or false result.**

### Boolean comparison operators include:
* equality == (It compares only values, not data types.)
* inequality !=
* Strict equality ===(It compares both value and data type.)
* strict inequality !==
* less than <
* greater than >
* less than or equal to <=
* greater than or equal to. >=
---

## Logical Operator
**. Logical operators are used to combine or manipulate Boolean values.**

### Common logical operators include:
* logical AND &&
* logical OR ||
* logical NOT !
---

## Assignment operators
**Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.**

* The most basic assignment operator is the equal (=)sign. 
---
## Unary Operators
** Unary operators operate on a single value or variable.**

### Common unary operators include:
* Increment Operator ++
* Decrement Operator --
---
## Type of Operator
**The Type of operator is a built-in operator in JavaScript that allows you to determine the data type of a variable or an expression.**
* It returns a string representing the type of operand.
* It is often used in conditional statements or for checking the type before performing certain operations. 

---
# Expression
**An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that can be evaluated to produce a single value.**
* Expressions can be simple or complex and are an integral part of JavaScript code.

### Examples of expressions include:
* Arithmetic expressions involving combining numbers with operators
* Variable expressions including combining variables with operators
* Function call expressions involving calling a function and using its return value
* Conditional expressions involve using the ternary operator to create conditional expressions.
