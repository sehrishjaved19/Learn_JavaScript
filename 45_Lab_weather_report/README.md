# 🌦️ Weather Report App

This project is a **simple weather application** that allows users to check the current weather conditions of any city in real time. It uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch live weather data such as temperature and description.

## 📂 Files Overview

* **index.html** — Contains the structure of the page, including the input form and result display section.
* **style.css** — Adds a modern and responsive design with gradients and glass-effect styling.
* **script.js** — Handles API requests, displays weather data, and manages errors if the city is not found.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters a city name in the input field.
2. On form submission, JavaScript sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. The weather details (temperature and description) are fetched and displayed on the page.
4. If an invalid city name is entered, an error message is shown.
