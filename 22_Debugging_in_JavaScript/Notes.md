# Introduction to Debugging in JavaScript
**Debugging in JavaScript is the process of of identifying and fixing errors, bugs and issues in your JavaScript code.**
* These errors can include syntax errors, logical errors, runtime errors, and other issues that prevent your JavaScript program from functioning as intended. 

### **Types of Errors **

#### 1. Syntax Errors
**Detected before execution** (while parsing the code)

#### 2. Runtime Errors
**Occur while the program is running** (e.g., TypeError, ReferenceError)

#### 3. Logical Errors
**Program runs successfully but gives wrong output**
