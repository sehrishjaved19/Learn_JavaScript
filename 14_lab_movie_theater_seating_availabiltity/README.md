# 🎟️ Movie Theater Seating Arrangement

This mini project demonstrates how to manage and visualize a simple movie theater seating layout using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It simulates seat booking both **manually** and through a **random seat selection** feature.

## 📁 Files Included
- **index.html** — The main webpage displaying the seating grid and button controls.  
- **style.css** — Defines the visual layout of seats, hover effects, and booked/available seat states.  
- **script.js** — Contains all JavaScript logic for seat management, booking, and UI updates.

## ⚙️ Features
* Displays a 3x3 grid representing theater seats (A1–C3).  
* Each seat can be **booked manually** by clicking on it.  
* A **random seat booking** button automatically selects one of the remaining available seats.  
* Alerts the user when all seats are booked.  
* Seat status updates visually — pink for available, red for booked.
